This repository contains lab assignments for Design for Testability (DFT), implemented in VHDL. The assignments focus on the verification of different digital circuits using fault modeling, test vector generation, and simulation techniques.

Lab-1 Contanis: 
Detecting stuck at faults at outputs for AND, OR, XOR, and odd function.
