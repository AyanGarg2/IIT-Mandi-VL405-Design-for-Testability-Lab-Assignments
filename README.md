This repository contains lab assignments for Design for Testability (DFT), implemented in VHDL. The assignments focus on the verification of different digital circuits using fault modeling, test vector generation, and simulation techniques.

Lab-1 Contains:
Detecting stuck-at faults at the outputs of AND, OR, XOR, and odd-parity logic functions.

Lab-2 Contains:
Design and verification of 3-bit and 4-bit even parity generator and checker circuits in VHDL, including stuck-at fault injection and exhaustive testbench-based fault analysis.

Lab-3 Contains:
Design and fault analysis of a hierarchical 4×16 decoder in VHDL, with input and output stuck-at fault injection and verification using targeted test vectors.

Lab-4 Contains:
Design and verification of an overlapping 111 sequence-detecting Moore FSM in VHDL, enhanced with a two-flip-flop scan path to improve controllability and observability.

Lab-5 Contains:
Implementation and verification of Design-for-Testability techniques in sequential digital circuits using scan-based testing and simulation-driven validation.

Lab-6 Contains:
Fan-in analysis of a 4-bit ALU and a 16×16 multiplier using a backtracing algorithm to quantify input dependencies and evaluate circuit testability.
